# functions
a function is a collection of code that can be executed by calling its name.

it is best to name functions after verbs. Functions are not executed until their name is called with parenthesis(): writing the function name simply references the function itself.

functions can accept parameter ( often called arguments).A parameter/argument is a data type or object that the function will operate on. parameters/arguments are placed in the parenthesis when calling the function. Multiple arguments are separated by a comma.

even if a function takes no argument you still need to use the parenthesis to execute it.

# variables
 variables in javascript are declared by using the let , var, or const keywords. the key word you use determines the scope or the variable. you can declare variable without a keyword and it will be a global variable.

 # objects
 objects have properties that can be accessed using dot (.) notation. when using dot notation you are requesting information or an action of that object. The part after the dot is either a property of the object or a function. EX: document.write
<!-- save everything you work on with crt+s -->
