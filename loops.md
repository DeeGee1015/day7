# control flow in javascript

## for/of loop
this loop will execute one time for however many items there are in the collection you run it on. Example:

```
for (item of collection) {
  // run function on an individual item
}
```

## while loop
this loop will execute forever while the passed in condition is true. it will stop when the condition becomes false

```
while (condition == true) {
  // do this
}
```

## if statement
an if statement will execute a specified block of code only if the passed in condition is true.

```
if (condition == true) {
  // do this
}
```


## if/else statement
just like an if statement, but it will execute the else block of code if the condition evaluates to false.

```
if (condition == true) {
  // run only if condition was true
} else {
  // run only if condition was false
}
```
